        <p> The application aims at providing a simple way-out for ensuring the child’s safety all the while he is by
          his own. The main objectives of this application are as follows:The application would provide the ability to
          divide interested geo-graphical area into different sub zones
          (e.g. safe, risky, highly risky etc.) and based on branching of these zones a different alert message would be
          sent to registered users. The application would also provide the ability to automatically send a message to
          registered users with mobile’s current location after user configured time interval. On geographical boundary
          branch, the application would warn user in the form of a message with beep so that mobile user would also be
          well informed about risk associated with his/her movement.
